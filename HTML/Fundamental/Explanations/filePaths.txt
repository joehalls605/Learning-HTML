Absolute Path:
An absolute path provides the complete route to a file or directory from the system root.
It's always from the route directory, / on unix, C:\ on windows.

Relative Path:
A relative path is based on your current working directory
It specifies the path relative to your current location.

You don't need to provide the absolute path, but instead describe how to get from your current location to the target.

For example if you're in /home/tux, a relative path might be ../documents/report.txt. 
This means go up one level, then into documents and find report.txt.

Single dot . - represents the current directory.
Double dot .. - represents the parent directory
