GET:

Purpose: Used to get data from a specific place.
Data in URL: Data appears in the URL after a question mark.
Visibility: Data is visible in the URL, so it's less secure for sensitive info.
Caching: Browser can save responses for faster access.
Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times should give the same result.
Examples: Loading a webpage, fetching an image, etc.

Case example:
Weather Information: Suppose you have a weather API that provides weather information based on a location. You could use a GET request to fetch the weather data by providing the location as a parameter in the URL. For example:

Request: GET https://weatherapi.com/data?location=NewYork
Response: Weather information for New York.




POST:
Need a server to use post

Purpose: Used to send data to a specific place for processing.
Data in Request Body: Data is sent within the request, not visible in the URL.
Visibility: Data is not visible in the URL, making it more secure.
Caching: Responses aren't cached by default.
Idempotent: Making the same request multiple times may have different results.
Examples: Submitting a form, uploading a file, etc.
In short, use GET for getting data and POST for sending or changing data. Each has its own characteristics, so choose based on your needs.


Case example:
User Registration: When a user signs up for a website, they typically submit their information (such as username, email, and password) using a POST request to a server for processing and storing.
