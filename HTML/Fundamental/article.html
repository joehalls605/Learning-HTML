<!--
The <article> element is used to represent an independent, self-contained piece of content within a webpage. It could be a blog post, a news article, a forum post, a comment, or any other piece of content that can stand alone and be syndicated separately from the rest of the page.
This improves the semantic structure of the webpage, making it more understandable for search engines, screen readers, and other tools parsing the HTML.
